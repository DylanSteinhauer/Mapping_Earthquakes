# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to create an earthquake map with three different base map styles and three separate overlays.
The base map options included are street view, satellite view, and dark view.
The overlays contain the following information: tectonic plate location data,
all the earthquakes that were recorded around the world in the past 7 days,
and all the major earthquakes (magnitude greater than 4.5) that were recorded around the world in the past 7 days.
