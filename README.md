# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to create an earthquake map with three different base map styles and three separate overlays.
The base map options included are street view, satellite view, and dark view.
The overlays contain the following information: tectonic plate location data,
all the earthquakes that were recorded around the world in the past 7 days,
and all the major earthquakes (magnitude greater than 4.5) that were recorded around the world in the past 7 days.
## Summary

The earthquakes displayed are shown by circles. These circles differ in shape and color based on the magnitude, 
with bigger circles and the color red representing larger magnitudes. The color index is shown on the legend in the lower right hand corner.
This page allows the user to toggle between the three different map styles. 
In addition, it allows the user to toggle the overlays containing the earthquake and tectonic plate information on and off.
